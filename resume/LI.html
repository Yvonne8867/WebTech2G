	<dt>&lt;!Entity-Relationship Diagram &gt;</dt>
	<dd> An entity relationship diagram (ERD) shows the relationships of entity sets stored in a database. An entity in this context is an object, a component of data. An entity set is a collection of similar entities. These entities can have attributes that define its properties.


By defining the entities, their attributes, and showing the relationships between them, an ER diagram illustrates the logical structure of databases.

ER diagrams are used to sketch out the design of a database. </dd>

	<dd>Documenting an Existing Database Using Data</dd>
		<dd>There are two reasons to create a database diagram. You're either designing a new schema or you need to document your existing structure.

If you have an existing database you need to to document, you create a database diagram using data directly from your database. You can export your database structure as a CSV file (there are some scripts on how to this here), then have a program generate the ERD automatically.

This will be the most accurate potrait of your database and will require no drawing on your part.

Here's an example of a very basic database structure generated from data.ÃŸ</dd>
